It is the year 2013. The surface of the planet has been ruined due to a cataclysmic event, causing the pool of capable employees to shrink immensely. You have traveled long and far through the tubes of Internetonia but have finally arrived at your destination. An enormous facility sprawls out in front of you as far as the eye can see. Through the misty haze you can just make out what looks like a backlit sign with the letter "K" flickering in and out...

"TIM MINKOV"

A strange sense of comfort and amusement creeps over you like a fresh summer's breeze. It's too late to turn back now: You came here to hire someone.

As you come closer to the structure, you notice something that wasn't apparent from a distance: A lightly colored <FONT COLOR="ca65e7">door</FONT>, hidden by the same sleek paintjob the rest of the facility wears.

What is your command, fair traveler?
